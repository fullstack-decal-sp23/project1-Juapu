        <h1 class = "blue">Hello. I'm Justin Pau, a software engineer.</h1>
        <p class = "blue" id = "who-am-i">I picked up programming when I came to college at UC Berkeley and absolutely loved it. I did not know anything about computers in high school and when I was learning how to program, I was worried my laptop might explode. But gradually, things started making sense and my programs would work. It was the best feeling in the world!</p>
